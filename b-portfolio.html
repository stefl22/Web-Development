            <div class="mobile">
                <p>I've loads of experience with programming languages. I'm studying for a bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Cybersecurity. I've taken classes as high as software development, and I hope to one day be a Software Engineer. Before this, I was working custodial at my university to pay the bills.</p>

                <p>I was born in Massachusetts before moving to Utah. I graduated high school in 2022 and I am attending Southern Utah University (SUU) starting shortly thereafter. It wasn't long before I stumbled on Tech Trove and its amazing internship program, and I've been here since.</p>

            <div class="mobile">
                <p>I say I like the three basics: reading, writing, and drawing. I also like to play games, and not just video games. Be it either video or board games, the games I enjoy are those I can play and enjoy with others!</p>
